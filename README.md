# 📊 TypeScript Data Project  
A data manipulation and statistics project developed during the **TypeScript for Beginners** course by **Origamid**.  
This project consumes a real API, organizes transaction data, and displays detailed statistics using TypeScript, HTML, and modular JavaScript.

---

## 🚀 About the Project  
This project was designed as a practical exercise in **TypeScript**, focused on understanding how to model data, work safely with types, and structure the code in well-organized modules.

Using data from an external API, the application:

- Fetches all transactions  
- Displays them in a clean and structured table  
- Calculates summaries and statistics  
- Highlights insights such as the best sales day and payment preferences  

It’s a hands-on project that connects **TypeScript fundamentals** with real-world problem solving.

## 🧩 Features  

- 📥 Fetching and normalizing API data  
- 📊 Rendering transaction data in a table  
- 💰 Total transaction value calculation  
- 💳 Grouping by payment method  
- ✔️ Grouping by status  
- 📅 Sales count per weekday  
- 🏆 Identification of the day with the most sales  
- 🗂️ Code organized into reusable modules  
- 🔒 Strong type definitions and type guards

## 🏫 Course  
Project developed during the **Origamid — TypeScript for Beginners** course.  
This course focuses on practical learning, teaching not only how TypeScript works, but also *why* certain structures are used — connecting theory with hands-on exercises.

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways  

This project highlights how **TypeScript improves code safety and clarity**, especially when working with external data.  
It reflects my growth in:

- Data modeling  
- Strong typing  
- Clean code structure  
- Problem-solving with real APIs  

A great step toward building more robust and professional front-end applications.
